/*
Class Definitions
object - thing (instance of class is a synonym)
   objects have data (feilds) and operations
      feilds are stored in variables wich belong to the object
             (instance VAriables)
      operation are coded in methods
some methods belong to the class not the object, they are static

construction of an object:
   classname variable;
      above declares variable to be a referance type, it may contain the adress of an object constructed from the class
      
calling a constructor:
   variable = new ClassName();
   
Calling A method of an object:
   variable.methodName();
variable = null
   variable refers to no object
   
if two vars refer to the same object, they are alieses

an object with no referances is garbage, the java garbage collecter will remove them
