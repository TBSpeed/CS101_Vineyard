 Test union, intersection, and set difference
 make set 10 with values 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
 Make set 50 with values 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21
 Set 99 is the union of sets 10 and 50
Set 99 is the union set of sets 10 & 50.
 Set 99 = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21}
Set 99 is: 
	{2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,3,9,15,21}
 Set 71 is the intersection of sets 10 and 50
Set 71 is the intersection set of sets 10 & 50.
 Set 71 = {6, 12, 18}
Set 71 is: 
	{6,12,18}
 Set 42 is the set difference set10 - set50
Set 42 is the difference set of sets 10 & 50.
 Set 42 = {2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20}
Set 42 is: 
	{2,4,8,10,14,16,20}
 Test attempting commands on null sets
 cannot test set 13 for emptiness, it is null
There is no set 13
 cannot add to null set 13
The set 13 does not exist.
 cannot remove from null set 13
There is not set 13, in which to find the value 2.
 cannot find size of null set 13
There is no set 13
 cannot make null set 13 empty
There was no set 13 to empty.
 cannot find value 2 in null set 13
There is not set 13, in which to find the value 2.
 cannot take union if one or more sets is null
The union could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The union could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The union could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
 cannot take intersection if one or more sets is null
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
 cannot take set difference if one or more sets is null
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
The intersection could not be done as one or more sets do not exist.
